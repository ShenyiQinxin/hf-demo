"I find myself asking this more and more: since when did boundaries and routine become more important than growth, adventure, and being there for others? Why do some people dread going to the plans they made, and would rather go to bed early so they can wake up for their morning routine? I won’t lie, I’ve been a victim of this. I think after the pandemic, I may have started ‘protecting my peace’ a bit too much. Thankfully, I snapped out of it. Grabbing coffee to catch up with a friend and not missing someone’s celebration is more important than being able to wake up at 6 a.m. to get 10,000 steps in before 9 a.m.

And yes, that will cause discomfort. It’s uncomfortable to break out of a routine you’ve grown used to, especially as someone who works a 9–5 job. Sometimes on weekends, you just want to stay in or catch up on all the tasks you put off during the week. But what if we also spent time fulfilling all the creative hobbies we lost touch with, like finally picking up that empty sketchbook that’s been sitting on your desk? Or giving your brain a break from the dopamine rush of scrolling on your phone and replacing it with a book? Or maybe finally seeing that friend you keep saying you never have time to meet with?

“If you never bleed, you’re never gonna grow,’ is what Taylor Swift sings in her song the 1. Why would anyone want to remain stagnant their whole lives? Where’s the fun, the adventure, the memories? Making that move to a new city might seem impossible, but once you do it, you’ll feel like a new person.

Every time I travel, I literally feel reborn. I know it’s been said a million times, but it truly makes me feel like I can do anything. Getting myself to a foreign country, interacting with new people, and immersing myself in the culture. I feel fulfilled, and it’s not coming from a routine. I’m not constantly trying to reach a new wellness goal, I’m not tracking my calories – I’m simply just being present. Mindfully existing can be challenging because it forces you to face the truth: this is the one life you have, and you’re stuck with yourself, whether you like it or not. So give yourself permission to grow, explore, and try new things. You’ll actually feel yourself begin to heal.

Get familiar with the unknown. The feeling of exploring a coffee shop you’ve never been to, the initial awkwardness of talking to a stranger, the unease of eating alone at a restaurant, the effort of dragging yourself off the couch to go dancing with your friends, the indulgence of letting yourself sleep until 11. There’s more to life than constant stability. When your days start blending together, make it a point to do at least one thing to break up the monotony: walk a different way to work, put on that dress that’s been hanging in your closet for a “special occasion,” or book the trip.

I was flipping through my journal the other day and realized I’ve had these same thoughts before. I made a list titled “The Art of Inconvenience.” The list includes:

Tea kettles

Record players

Moka pots

Bookstores

Thrifting

Polaroids

High heels

Magazines

A bit random, I know, but what ties them together for me is this: they require more effort to enjoy than the simpler alternatives. You may walk faster in your everyday flats, but you’ve been wanting to wear those heels, and you should – even if they’re going to slow you down. It’s easier to play a summarized version of an article on your phone than to actually read it in a magazine. It’s more convenient to use the espresso machine, but with the moka pot, the flavor is so much richer.

I’m currently reading Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert, and with each page, I feel my life changing. One key takeaway from this book is that living abundantly requires making time and overcoming the fear of not being good enough.

In Part III, Gilbert discusses how not everyone needs higher education to chase their dreams, and that ultimately, it’s on you to do the work yourself: “The hours that you will then put into practice, study, auditions, and creation will be entirely up to you.”

Working toward a goal, a project, a dream – it requires real dedication. It’s inconvenient. It’s uncomfortable. It’s a lot of sitting in silence. It’s having uninspired days. But it’s also being struck with creativity in the middle of the night. It’s the rush of your fingers flying across the keyboard, trying to keep up with the ideas racing through your mind. It’s the new people, art, and experiences you encounter along the way.

So if you don’t want to listen to Taylor Swift, Elizabeth Gilbert, or me (who’s currently spilling thoughts into this Substack draft), then listen to yourself. Find what truly fills your cup, and go after it. Throw yourself into it completely. Make it your whole personality. Dive deep into a project. The process will bring hardships and frustrations, but the result is a sense of renewal and enlightenment.

It’s all connected: the relationships you nurture, the hobbies you pursue, your travels, your daily life. You’ll stumble, feel exhausted, and be hard on yourself. But your patience and persistence will ultimately pay off. Leaning into that discomfort and pushing yourself, whether it’s setting aside an hour to write, reworking a painting again and again, spending hours perfecting an outfit, or saying yes to last-minute plans, will ultimately feel more rewarding because you didn’t give in to those limiting beliefs."," It’s uncomfortable to break out of a routine you’ve grown used to, especially as someone who works a 9–5 job .
